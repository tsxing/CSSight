                    <h2>Skeuomorphism</h2>
                    <p>
                        Skeuomorphism is a design trend when interface objects mimic their real-world counterparts in how they appear or how the user can interact with them. For example, when a watch face is designed to look like an actual watch. Or, how the calculator app looks like an actual calculator object and how the icon for trashed files looks like a trash can. This trend emerged in the early days of personal computers and graphical user interfaces.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Skeuomorphic design was said to make digital interfaces less efficient- many designers therefore adopted a more minimalistic approach (flat design). Around the mid 2010s, more minimalistic styles have replaced the skeuomorphism design. 
                    </p>

                    <h2>Flat Design</h2>
                    <p>Flat design uses 2d elements and bright colors, contrasting the skeumorphic 3d style of mimicing real-life  objects. Flat design ensures responsive design works well (they also load fast). However, a lack of "depth" on the page may appear too plain or simple. </p>
                    <p>Personally, I like this design- it gives a very clean and refreshing touch to the page. I think this design suits a page best when the page has a decent amount of (strategically colored) widgets to create a modern look. This also seems to suit elements with a less round and relatively sharper border-radius.</p>

                    <h2>Neumorphism</h2>
                    <p>
                        This is a design trend between flat design and skeuomorphism.  Neumorphism focuses on a consistent soft visual with clean lines, minimalist aesthetic, and elements that appear carved or extruded from the background. A key characteristic of neumorphic elements is that they are raised shape with the same color as the background, making them appear as protruding rather than floating. 
                    </p>
                    <p>I think this brings a "fresh" feel to the interface, and it's much easier to code compared to some designs, like claymorphic designs. However, when there's lots of elements on the interface, the elements' shadows may appear crowded to users, which makes the "protruding" design rather unnecessary. In addition, neumorphic design may not compliment a product where much photos are needed, such as a blog or photography site. Neumorphic elements radiate a minimalistic aesthetic, which essentially "require" images that radiate the same aesthetic: photos that either contain the color palette used in the neumorphic interface or photos that doesn't have many subjects and color variations are good choices. Note how many neumorphic designs (see with a simple Google Search) doesn't actually have any photos. </p>

                    <h2>Glassmorphism</h2>
                    <p>
                        This design trend is characterized by semi-transparent backgrounds and layering, presenting a frosted and futuristic aesthetic. A glass effect on elements can enhance their readability by adding contrast between text and background elements, or by adding a subtle depth in the design with soft gradient colors. The style can be seen on Apple's products, such as the iPhone widgets and macbook launchpad.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I think this style is really suitable for an interface simulating that of phone widgets or laptop windows. In contrast, they're not suitable for data dashboards and ultra-minimalist interfaces. Glassmorphism can appear visually intricate with unnecessary visual noise, distracting users from data-heavy content (i.e. tables, graphs, charts). This style of design also doesn't work as ideally with dark modes compared to other design styles like neumorphic ones: the frosted effect is more noticeable with light or neutral backgrounds. Additionally, this design may be laggy on low-end devices, as the many layers used in this design can be resource-intensive. I find glassmorphism designs running much slower in my browser when I code it with CSS. 
                    </p>

                    <h2>Claymorphism</h2>
                    <p>
                        This is characterized by "fun" and 3d dome-like elements, and builds off from neumorphic design. Claymorphic design gives a softer and "floating" effect with a darker outer shadow and two inner shadows. Overuse may make the product look childish, but using "minimal typography, strong accent colors good contrast" (Malewicz) could counter this concern.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I first encountered claymorphic styles when I saw a Codepen clay human CSS project. This is a cute style, but it's relatively hard to code with CSS.
                    </p>
